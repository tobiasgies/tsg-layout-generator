# tsg-layout-generator
Google Apps Script package to generate Google Slides stream layouts based on Google Sheets data
as well as statistics imported from [racetime.gg](https://www.racetime.gg).

This needs to run in the context of a Google Sheets spreadsheet. I currently just deploy it using
[Clasp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/clasp) on my local machine.
